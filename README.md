# Snake-Game

Snake game is a traditional 90s and 2000s kids game which is played by most cell phone users.
The game involves movement of array of points(here I have used array of image dots) which is identified as snake and collision between 
this array of points and randomly generated point(known as snake's prey or food).

Score of game: It is the count of no of collision between snake and prey(frog).

Game over: Game finished when the snake collides itself or the wall(i.e boundries of application frame).

Each time when score increases the snake grows larger that is,the no of points in array gets increases one by one.
